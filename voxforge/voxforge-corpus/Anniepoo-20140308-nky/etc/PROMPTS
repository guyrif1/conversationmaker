Anniepoo-20140308-nky/mfc/b0069 COULD THE INCIDENT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH JEANNE AND PIERRE
Anniepoo-20140308-nky/mfc/b0070 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO FIRE WITHOUT HITTING HIM
Anniepoo-20140308-nky/mfc/b0071 THERE WAS NO ANSWER FROM THE OTHER SIDE
Anniepoo-20140308-nky/mfc/b0072 THEN HE HASTENED ON AS PIERRE HAD GUIDED HIM
Anniepoo-20140308-nky/mfc/b0073 WITH THESE ARGUMENTS HE CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HE SHOULD GO ON ALONE
Anniepoo-20140308-nky/mfc/b0074 YET BEHIND THEM THERE WAS ANOTHER AND MORE POWERFUL MOTIVE
Anniepoo-20140308-nky/mfc/b0075 IN THAT CASE HE COULD NOT MISS THEM IF HE USED CAUTION
Anniepoo-20140308-nky/mfc/b0076 BEFORE PHILIP COULD RECOVER HIMSELF JEANNE'S STARTLED GUARDS WERE UPON HIM
Anniepoo-20140308-nky/mfc/b0077 IT IS THE NEAREST REFUGE
Anniepoo-20140308-nky/mfc/b0078 THERE WAS PRIDE AND STRENGTH THE RING OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE
