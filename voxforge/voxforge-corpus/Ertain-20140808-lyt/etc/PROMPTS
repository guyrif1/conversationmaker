Ertain-20140808-lyt/mfc/b0090 THE CHURCHILL NARROWED AND ITS CURRENT BECAME SWIFTER AS THEY PROGRESSED
Ertain-20140808-lyt/mfc/b0091 FOR A FULL HALF MINUTE JEANNE LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT SPEAKING
Ertain-20140808-lyt/mfc/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
Ertain-20140808-lyt/mfc/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
Ertain-20140808-lyt/mfc/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
Ertain-20140808-lyt/mfc/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
Ertain-20140808-lyt/mfc/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
Ertain-20140808-lyt/mfc/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
Ertain-20140808-lyt/mfc/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
Ertain-20140808-lyt/mfc/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
