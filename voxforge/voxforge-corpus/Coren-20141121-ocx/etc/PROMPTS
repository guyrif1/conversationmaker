Coren-20141121-ocx/mfc/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
Coren-20141121-ocx/mfc/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
Coren-20141121-ocx/mfc/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
Coren-20141121-ocx/mfc/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
Coren-20141121-ocx/mfc/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
Coren-20141121-ocx/mfc/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
Coren-20141121-ocx/mfc/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
Coren-20141121-ocx/mfc/a0362 NOPE NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
Coren-20141121-ocx/mfc/a0363 IT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO SMASH THE MARKET
Coren-20141121-ocx/mfc/a0364 WE HAVE PLENTY OF CAPITAL OURSELVES AND YET WE WANT MORE
