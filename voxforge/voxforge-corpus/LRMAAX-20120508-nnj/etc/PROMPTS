LRMAAX-20120508-nnj/mfc/rb-11 A GOOD SOLUTION WOULD BE TO USE SPEECH RECOGNITION
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj/mfc/rb-12 ESPECIALLY SINCE MOST OF THESE DEVICES OFTEN ALREADY HAVE A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj/mfc/rb-13 MANY PHONES ALREADY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF SO-CALLED VOICE DIALING
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj/mfc/rb-14 A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IS THE STILL LIMITED COMPUTING POWER OF THESE PHONES
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj/mfc/rb-15 ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS TO USE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj/mfc/rb-16 THAT WAY THE SOFTWARE ONLY NEEDS TO COMPARE
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj/mfc/rb-17 THE VOICE INPUT WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OPTIONS
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj/mfc/rb-18 MODERN COMPUTERS HAVE FAR MORE COMPUTING POWER THAN HAND-HELD DEVICES
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj/mfc/rb-19 THAT MEANS THAT WHEN A PROGRAMMER WANTS TO WRITE SPEECH RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
LRMAAX-20120508-nnj/mfc/rb-20 IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP IN MIND ON WHICH HARDWARE THE SOFTWARE WILL RUN
