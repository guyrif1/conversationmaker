DavidSowerby-20130308-ycz/mfc/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
DavidSowerby-20130308-ycz/mfc/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME

DavidSowerby-20130308-ycz/mfc/ar-16 JUST THEN THE OLD RAT SAW ARTHUR STOP HE ORDERED COARSELY
