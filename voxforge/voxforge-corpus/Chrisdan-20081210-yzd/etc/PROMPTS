Chrisdan-20081210-yzd/mfc/a0352 I'M SURE GOING ALONG WITH YOU ALL ELIJAH
Chrisdan-20081210-yzd/mfc/a0353 HERE THE EXPLOSION OF MIRTH DROWNED HIM OUT
Chrisdan-20081210-yzd/mfc/a0354 FRESH MEAT THEY FAILED TO OBTAIN
Chrisdan-20081210-yzd/mfc/a0355 A BURST OF LAUGHTER WAS HIS REWARD
Chrisdan-20081210-yzd/mfc/a0356 YOU DON'T CATCH ME AT ANY SUCH FOOLISHNESS
Chrisdan-20081210-yzd/mfc/a0357 A MONTH PASSED BY AND BONANZA CREEK REMAINED QUIET
Chrisdan-20081210-yzd/mfc/a0358 THEY CONTINUED VALIANTLY TO LIE BUT THE TRUTH CONTINUED TO OUTRUN THEM
Chrisdan-20081210-yzd/mfc/a0359 EARTH AND GRAVEL SEEMED TO FILL THE PAN
Chrisdan-20081210-yzd/mfc/a0360 BUT HE NO LONGER CARED QUITE SO MUCH FOR THAT FORM OF DIVERSION
Chrisdan-20081210-yzd/mfc/a0361 BUT HE DID NOT BROACH IT PREFERRING TO MATURE IT CAREFULLY
