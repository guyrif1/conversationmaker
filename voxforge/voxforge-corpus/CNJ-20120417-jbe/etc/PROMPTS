CNJ-20120417-jbe/mfc/ar-07 ONE RAINY DAY THE RATS HEARD A GREAT NOISE IN THE LOFT
CNJ-20120417-jbe/mfc/ar-08 THE PINE RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN SO THAT THE BARN WAS RATHER UNSAFE
CNJ-20120417-jbe/mfc/ar-09 AT LAST THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND FELL TO THE GROUND
CNJ-20120417-jbe/mfc/ar-10 THE WALLS SHOOK AND ALL THE RATS' HAIR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
CNJ-20120417-jbe/mfc/ar-11 THIS WON'T DO SAID THE CAPTAIN I'LL SEND OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
CNJ-20120417-jbe/mfc/ar-12 WITHIN FIVE HOURS THE TEN SCOUTS CAME BACK AND SAID
CNJ-20120417-jbe/mfc/ar-13 WE FOUND A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR US ALL
CNJ-20120417-jbe/mfc/ar-14 THERE IS A KINDLY HORSE NAMED NELLY A COW A CALF AND A GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE
CNJ-20120417-jbe/mfc/ar-15 THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR LITTLE HOUSES AND STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
